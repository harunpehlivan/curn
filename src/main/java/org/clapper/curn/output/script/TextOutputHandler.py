"""
Python/Jython version of the curn-supplied C{TextOutputHandler}
(org.clapper.curn.output.TextOutputHandler). This script must be used
in conjunction with curn's ScriptOutputHandler class
(org.clapper.curn.output.script.ScriptOutputHandler), which requires
the presence of the Jakarta version of the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF).

This script is intended primarily as a demonstration, though it is a
fully-functioning script-based output handler.

In addition to the configuration parameters supported by the
ScriptOutputHandler class and its parent FileOutputHandler class, this
script also honors an optional Message parameter. If present in the
configuration section, the Message parameter defines an arbitrary
string to be displayed at the top of the output.
